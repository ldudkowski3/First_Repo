                <p>The Flash is an amazing show on the CW. It stars Grant Gustin as Barry Allen, aka The Flash. By day,
                    he works as CSI for the Central City Police Department. By night (or whenever there is a meta-human
                    attack)
                    he runs around protecting the city from the dangerous meta-humans. He dons a technologically advaced
                    super suit that holds up to his super speed made by Cisco Ramone, who fights alongside him as Vibe.
                    His super friends also include Killer Frost and Kid Flash. Elongated Man used to fight with him as
                    well until the actor got fired from the show for inapproriate comments made years ago. One of my
                    favorite characters is Joe West, father to Iris and Wally West, and adoptive father to Barry. The
                    main villain in the show is the Reverse Flash, played by Tom Cavanaugh. I really enjoy the
                    multiverse theory where there are infintie number of Flashes (with their own suits and abilities).
                    It is cool to see the creativity behind this comic and this network.</p>
